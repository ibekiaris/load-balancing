ibekiaris/load-balancing is a PHP 7.2+ library implementing load balancing in PHP.

## About

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)):

> In computing, load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives.[1] Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability through redundancy. Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process

## Installation

The preferred method of installation is via [Packagist](https://packagist.org) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command to install the package and add it as a requirement to your project's `composer.json`:
